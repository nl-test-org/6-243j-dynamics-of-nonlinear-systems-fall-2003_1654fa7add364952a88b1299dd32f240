Prerequisite: [6.241](/courses/6-241j-dynamic-systems-and-control-spring-2011/) or an equivalent course.

Information Resources and Literature
------------------------------------

This year, there will be no required textbook. All necessary information will be supplied in the lecture notes.

The books _Nonlinear Systems_ by Hassan K. Khalil, published by Prentice Hall, and the more advanced _Nonlinear Systems: Analysis, Stability, and Control_ by Shankar Sastry, published by Springer, can both serve as basic references on Nonlinear Systems Theory, frequently covering the topics skipped in the lectures.

Prof. Alexandre Megretski

Homework
--------

Homework assignments are usually given on Wednesdays. Homework papers are to be submitted during the lecture hours on the following Wednesday. The homework will be corrected, graded, and returned as soon as possible. Solutions to the homework will be distributed when the corrected homework is returned.

Team work on home assignments is strictly encouraged, as far as generating ideas and arriving at the best possible solution is concerned. However, you have to write your own solution texts (and your own code, when needed).

MATLAB®
-------

MATLAB®, the "language of technical computing'', will be used in some assignments. We will need Simulink®, Control Systems, and LMI Control Toolboxes. You may wish to consult its online help for general information and for specific commands for simulating and analysing systems.

Examinations
------------

There will be two take-home quizzes, to be completed and returned within 24 hours, but no final exam. The quizzes will cover the theory of 6.243J (divided as equally as possible). The questions will be based on the ideas used in the problem set solutions made available at least a week before the test. No homework will be given on the last Wednesdays before the quizzes. No cooperation is allowed on take-home quizzes.

Grading
-------

The letter grade will be determined at the end of the semester from a numerical grade N, obtained from the formula

N=0.5\*H+0.25\*Q1+0.25\*Q2

where H is the average homework grade, and Q1, Q2 are quiz grades (H, Q1, Q2 are numbers between 0 and 100). From the distribution of N for the entire class, boundaries will be chosen to define letter grades. For students near the boundaries, other factors may be taken into account to determine the letter grade, such as effort, classroom activity, etc.
