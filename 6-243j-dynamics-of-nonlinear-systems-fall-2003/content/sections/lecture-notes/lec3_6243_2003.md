description: 'Lecture 3: Arguments based on continuity of functions are common in
  dynamical system analysis. They rarely apply to quantitative statements,instead
  being used mostly for proofs of existence of certain objects (equilibria,open or
  closed invariant set,etc.) Alternatively, continuity arguments can be used to show
  that certain qualitative conditions cannot be

  satis?ed for a class of systems.'
