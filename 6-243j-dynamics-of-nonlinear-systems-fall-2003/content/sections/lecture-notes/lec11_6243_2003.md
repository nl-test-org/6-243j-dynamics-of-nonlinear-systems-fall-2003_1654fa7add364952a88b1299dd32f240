description: 'Lecture 11: Lyapunov analysis,which uses monotonicity of a given function
  of system state along trajectories of a given dynamical system,is a major tool of
  nonlinear system analysis. It is possible,however,to use monotonicity of volumes
  of subsets of the state space to

  predict certain properties of system behavior.This lecture gives an introduction
  to such methods.'
